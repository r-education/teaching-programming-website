## What are personas?

To help us identify features needed by the tools and templates for teaching
programming, we are developing personas. Personas are imaginary users for a
project. By articulating their background, the problem they face, and how your
project is going to help them, personas provide a way to determine the scope of
your project, identify use cases, and essential features. The Carpentries use
[this
approach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html#learner-profiles)
when designing new lessons.


## The personas

### The lesson creators

* _Robin_ is a graduate student in neurosciences and has developed a Python
  library for image analysis. They want to create a tutorial for this library
  that they will teach to other students and postdocs at an international
  conference. Robin wants to make this tutorial and the notes for this workshop
  available online, but they don't have time to create a template that looks
  good.
  
* _Stacey_ has been using R for 10+ years and teaches a semester-long course in
  statistics (using R) to graduate students in social sciences. She uses a
  flipped-classroom setting: the students go through the lecture notes and
  short-exercises (formative assessments) outside of class. They come to class
  to ask questions and work on problems that integrate the skills taught in the
  lessons.
  

### The lesson contributors

* _Sam_ enjoyed attending Robin's workshop. He is a postdoc who published a
  paper that used Robin's Python library. He would like to contribute to Robin's
  tutorial by adding some tips on how to get started based on his own experience
  with this library. He knows how to create a pull request on GitHub, and uses
  markdown regularly to type his ideas, and notes.
  
* _Rosa_ is a teaching assistant for Stacey's class. One of her responsibilities
  is to propose updates on the lectures and exercises students go through on
  their own based on the questions they ask in class. She has been using R for
  just over a year. Stacey values her perspective to make the lecture notes more
  approachable to beginners. She's just learned how to submit pull requests.
  
### The lessons adapters and the teachers

* _Pinja_ found Robin's tutorial online started using this library for her work.
  She will teach the tutorial to people in her lab, but wants to switch the
  dataset to something more relevant to their research. Robin has integrated
  extensive notes in the tutorial that will be helpful for Pinja to prepare. She
  wants to see the notes as she's teaching but she thinks they will be too
  distracting for people attending the workshop to see.
  
* _Norma_, who is starting as a new professor at the same university as Stacey,
  wants to use a flipped-classroom approach to the statistics class she will be
  teaching to biologists. Stacey encourages her to use her lesson as a starting
  point. Norma finds that adapting the lessons for her own needs saved her a lot
  of time, and allowed her to provide feedback on the pedagogical approach taken
  by Stacey.

### The learners

* _Sofie_ is attending Robin's workshop and has just started grad school. She
  has taken a few Python tutorials online. She wants to make sure that she will
  be able to reproduce the analyses demonstrated during the workshop on her own,
  and use the dataset provided in the workshop to learn other data manipulation
  and visualization skills, as she hasn't generated her own data yet.

* _Ayoub_ has discovered the website for Stacey's class as he was looking up how
  to perform an ANCOVA in R for his senior thesis in social sciences. He found
  that this website contained information that complemented the general
  statistics course he took the previous year. The learning objectives at the
  beginning of each lesson, the regular exercises to check that he is
  understanding each concept, and the summary of the keypoints covered in the
  lesson, are improving his understanding of the connections among the different
  concepts. The glossary also helps him to understand the technical found in the
  lesson.


<!-- ## What are the personas telling us? -->

<!-- - Background: \(R\)markdown, Git/GitHub -->
<!-- - language agnostic (R or Python) -->
<!-- - solutions to exercises should be hidden -->
<!-- - the packages and other system requirements needed to reproduce the code -->
<!--   included in the lessons (and the exercises) need to be made clear to the -->
<!--   learners -->
<!-- - the organization of the files in the repository should be obvious -->
<!-- - learner/teacher view for the lessons -->
<!-- - glossary -->
<!-- - easy to retrieve datasets used in the lesson -->
<!-- - support for translations -->
<!-- - accessible -->
<!-- - limit cognitive load/user friendly by focusing on a single syntax (markdown -->
<!--   everywhere); users shouldn't have to edit YAML -->
